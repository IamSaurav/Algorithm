 Introduction:
 AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.
 Rules:
 (a) The difference of heights of the two child of any node should be at most one.
     When they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore balancing.
     balance = height of left branch - height of right branch
     So, if difference is -1, 0 and 1 the node is called balanced
     Example 1:
          X
        /
       Y
      /
     Z
     balance of X = 2 - 0 = 2
     balance of Y = 1 - 0 = 1
     balance of Z = 0 - 0 = 0
     Example 2:
     X
      \
       Y
      /  \
     Z    X1
           \
            X2
 balance X = 0 - 3 = -3
 balance Y = 1 - 2 = -1
 balance Z = 0 - 0 = 0
 balance X1 = 0 - 1 = -1
 balance X2 = 0 - 0 = 0
 
 (b) Can't insert duplicate values.
 (c) A node can have at max two child nodes
 (d) Value of left node should be smaller than value of the parent node. Which is same as binary tree.
 (e) Value of right node should be greater than value of the parent node. Which is same as binary tree.
 
 Q: Why AVL Tree? When we have binary search tree.
 Ans: The time complexity for searching an element in AVL tree is much better compared to bst.
      Let's say we will have to search a 20 in below tree, we will have to take 3 steps to get there.
      7
       \
        10
       /  \
      8   15
           \
            20
 
     Let's convert this tree into a AVL tree and see if time complexity reduces.
     10
     / \
    8   15
   /     \
  7      20
  Now let's see how many steps to get node with value 20.
  20 is >10 so we will find in the right side, if we couldn't find in this step we will further search in it's child node.
  In next search we get the matching value of 20. So, it took 2 steps to search. This difference becomes significant in larger trees.
 Time complexity of an AVL tree is O(h) where h is height of tree, whereas in bst it can be O(n) in worst case...
 where n is the number of nodes.
