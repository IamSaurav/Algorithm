 Idea:
 Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
 Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
 
 Q: What is Merge?
 Ans: Merge is an algorithm, it plays a critical role in the merge sort algorithm.
      It recursively divide the list into sublists of (roughly) equal length, until each sublist contains only one element.
      A list containing a single element is, by definition, sorted.
      Repeatedly merge sublists to create a new sorted sublist until the single list contains all elements.
      The single list is the sorted list.
 
 Q: How do you sort while merging back 2 or more elements?
 Ans: It is an approach explained below.
      [1 5 6]  [0 2 4]
      1. We will compare these two array elements, by incrasing the counter. We use i for first array, j for second array
      and k to keep the sorted elements.
      2. First we will check if arr[i] < arr[j]
 
 Description:
 Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.

        // To sort here we need three counters, i for first array, j for second array and k to keep the sorted items.
        // 1 > 0, thus it will take 0 and place it in the sorted array. Also it will increase the counter only whose item got picked here j.

        // 1 > 0         arr[k] = 0 j+=1 k+1

        // arr[k] = 6 i+=1 k+1

        // Ans: Once we got the place of elements it belongs, we place it there in input array.

        // Sometimes what happens, all elements of one array are taken out and placed in the sorted array, but few items are still lying  there in another array, so we just copy those one by one towards the end and those will be automatically sorted.
        // Those elements left there for a reason, those were larger numbers and thus left behind.
        // Always remember whose item we're picking counter will increase on their side only.
