/********** INTRODUCTION **************
 Tree is a non-linear data structure, because it's nodes connects to multiple node.
 In general tree each node can have infinite number of children.
 In Binary tree each node has at most two nodes left and right, we have implemented binary tree below.
 Left child node must be smaller than parent node.
 Right child node must be greater than parent node.
 The topmost node is called root of the tree.
 The nodes directly connected called its children.
 Use case-file system on a computer.

    /*
     To delete, first we need to find the node which has the same data, by iterating the tree.
     There can be three scenarios while iterating, data is equal, smaller or greater.
     If data is smaller, then we will probably find that node in left side.
     If data is greater, then we will probably find that node in right side.
     If data is same, then simply we cannot delete, we still need to do some operation. There can be children of this node,
        and if you simply delete that node by assigning nil then all of it's children will be lost. Also binary tree has a rule..
        data of left child should be smaller and data of right child should be greater than the parent node.
     If data is same and it is a leaf node(a node with no children), then just delete by assigning nil and you're done.
     If data is same and it has one child on left, then make that child as parent by replacing and you're done.
     If data is same and it has one child on right, then make that child as parent by replacing and you're done.
     If data is same and it has both the children, then find a node with smallest data on right side, assign it's data to
         current node then delete that smallest node.
         Q.Why smallest?
         Ans: Two reasons.
            1.Smallest will always be leaf node, then it becomes easy to delete. just assign nil.
            2. Right chlid's value will be greater than this one, which is rule for binary tree.
         Q.Why only on right side? why not left?
         Ans: Because if you make smallest node of left side as parent, then left child's value may be greater which is against rule.
         Q. Why replace data?
         Ans: By replacing data we keep it's references, which is with it's children and parent. Also after assigning data
             we get a leaf node to delete which is simple.
         Q.Why don't you assign nil immdeiately after replacing? Why recursion again?
         Ans: Just to avoid duplicate code, we have already written a line to delete a node.
